   <p>haha, sorry for the cheesy and corny spotify playlist you just saw :^</p>
   <p>but yes, all of the things you saw are true, and i'm indeed scared to say all of that face to face nor by text.</p>
   <p>we've been friends for quite a while and i enjoyed your company along the way, thank you for that. </p>
   <p>i've been thinking about it for a while now, but i guess now is the time to do so :]</p>
   <br>
   <p>I made all of this just to let it all out so it wouldn't be a burden to me and my feelings?, idk just to get rid of my thoughts I guess?</p>
   <p>i know im not like her, the one you were expecting, but yeah "shoot your shot i guess..?"</p>
   <br>
   <p>i will respect all of your decisions, don't worry we're still going to be friends even if this went wrong lol </p>
   <p>(i know this is probably not what you were expecting but here we are :V)</p>
   <p>anyways, feel free to give me answers. i'll see ya later :]</p>
